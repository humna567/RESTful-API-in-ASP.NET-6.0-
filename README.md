# RESTful-API-in-ASP.NET-6.0-
I've developed a hotel booking management REST API using ASP.NET 6.0. This powerful API allows you to interact with hotel booking data through HTTP request methods like POST, GET, PUT, DELETE, and GETALL.
 
 ðŸ“Œ Features:
POST: Add new hotel bookings.
GET: Retrieve specific booking details.
PUT: Update existing booking information.
DELETE: Remove bookings when needed.
GETALL: Fetch a list of all hotel bookings.

Need a powerful backend for your hotel booking system? Let's connect!
